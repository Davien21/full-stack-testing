# Authenticated Integration

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/web-application-testing/authenticated-integration/intro-to-auth-integration" />

Just like in higher level E2E tests, you often are required to simulate an
authenticated user. This involves a few things:

1. Inserting a test user in the database
1. Creating a session for that user
1. Setting the session ID in the cookie header for requests
1. Handling Verification (like 2FA)
1. Asserting the auth state is updated properly in responses

Depending on what you're testing, this may require a bit of work because you
can't just set `document.cookie` and expect a `new Request()` to have the cookie
value in there. The browser is the one that sets the request's cookie headers
when an actual request is made. So if we create a request object in our test,
the source code that checks `request.headers.get('cookie')` will just get
`null`.

This means two things:

1. If the request object is made by our source code, you won't be able to test
   it at this level (you'll have to use E2E)
1. If the thing you're testing accepts a request object (or you can intercept
   it), you can set the `cookie` header yourself.

## Loaders/Actions

In this case, we're the ones creating the `Request` object, so we can set this
object ourselves and we already have in a previous exercise:

```ts
new Request(someUrl, {
	headers: { cookie: someCookieValue },
})
```

The trickiest bit here is that our application utilities are all about creating
`set-cookie` headers for a response, not `cookie` headers for a request. But
we've already used `set-cookie-header` parser to deal with this in playwright
and it will be exactly the same in vitest with our integration tests as well.

## Remix Stub

If you want to test your whole route, then you'll want to do something like
this:

```tsx filename=app/routes/hello.tsx
import {
	json,
	type ActionFunctionArgs,
	type LoaderFunctionArgs,
} from '@remix-run/node'
import { useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react'

export async function loader({ request }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
	const user = await getUser(request)
	return json({ title: `Hello ${user.name}` })
}
export default function HelloRoute() {
	const data = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()

	return <div>{data.title}</div>
}
```

```tsx filename=app/routes/hello.test.tsx
import { createRemixStub } from '@remix-run/testing'
import { default as HelloRoute, loader } from './hello.tsx'

// ...

const App = createRemixStub([
	{
		path: '/hello',
		Component: HelloRoute,
		loader, // <-- pass the loader as-is
	},
])
```

But our loader in this example has this `getUser` utility which presumably looks
up the user by the cookie in the request. Since Remix is responsible for
creating this request, there's no way for us to set the cookie... Or is there?
ðŸ˜‰

```tsx
const App = createRemixStub([
	{
		path: '/hello',
		Component: HelloRoute,
		loader: async args => {
			args.request.headers.set('cookie', 'my=cookie')
			return loader(args)
		},
	},
])
```

In this way we can still get full coverage of the `loader`, but we also get the
opportunity to customize the data sent into the loader to simulate the logged in
state. A win-win.
